## Events ##

Whether you live locally or, like us, are traveling from far away, we are thrilled to be celebrating our wedding with you.

We hope that you will enjoy your time in the Upper Valley and that you have a chance to explore some of the area that we called home for a decade. If you have any questions, please [contact us](/about/contact.html).
