Kristen “HooHoo” Post is the bride’s stunt double and one half of the Reidoisio twins. Known for her delicious home cooking, dinosaur mating call hiccups, and ability to bring Pinterest to life, Kristen is the triple threat of the MOH field. Yes, we’re talking beauty, brawn, and brains.

Susan "The Rock" Schnur is the bride’s soon-to-be sister-in-law. Tamer of the wild Starfish the Cat, fellow mass spectrometer-er, and crafty knitter, Susan brings experience handling the groom to the table. And we all know how important groom-wrangling can be.

#### Groomsman ####

Carl “CJ” Johnson is a long time friend of both the groom and bride. Scientist by trade, farmer/hunter/fisherman by reputation, Carl can do just about anything. Seriously. Ask him about our ice fishing escapades. He’ll bring valuable skills and experience to the party.
