### Our Story ###

</div>

**How they met:**

Although they were introduced online, David and Felicia first met on the Rail Trail in Lebanon, NH. Felicia had found a lost dog (named Buster) wandering the trail and was searching for its owner. David cycled by and stopped to help. After safely delivering the dog, they made plans for their first date.

**First date:**

Hiking the Velvet Rocks trail in Hanover, NH. It was a challenging (read: slippery) hike whose views didn't quite live up to the hype, but they found yet another lost dog. They nicknamed it “Columbus” for its unwavering certainty that it was heading in the right direction, when clearly it wasn't. Columbus was reunited with its owner at the trailhead.

**When they officially became a couple:**

On August 1, 2010, hiking at Holt’s Ledge in Enfield, NH. They did not find another dog, but did come across a rather brave chipmunk, now immortalized in haiku:

> Our wee furry friend
> Is most persistent indeed.
> Guard your lunch with care!

After dinner they watched the worst movie ever made, Osmosis Jones, and have been inseparable ever since.

**How he proposed:**

David proposed on August 3, 2013 in Zermatt, Switzerland during a sunset hike near the Matterhorn. Felicia was so surprised, she blurted out, "Are you kidding me?!" before answering with a resounding "Yes!"
