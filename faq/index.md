- Where should I park? - Hanover is notoriously difficult when it comes to parking. That's why we have parking available at the ceremony behind Wentworth and Dartmouth Halls. Reception parking is available across the road from the DOC House, at the Hanover Country Club. You can see exactly where parking is on [this map](/events/directions.html).

Keep in mind that this is March in NH when choosing your footwear, so there is a chance for anything from snow and ice to rain and mud.
