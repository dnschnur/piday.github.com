Our recommendations are the [Residence Inn](http://www.marriott.com) or the [Courtyard Marriott](http://www.marriott.com), both conveniently located 10 minutes from the wedding festivities. Situated in Centerra Park, these hotels are within walking distance of the Coop grocery store, Margarita's Mexican restaurant, and the bride's former employer, Adimab.

One place not to miss is [Morano Gelato](http://www.moranogelatohanover.com). This the bride and groom's favorite place in the Upper Valley. Touted as [the best gelato in America](http://www.forbes.com/sites/larryolmsted/2011/07/05/the-best-gelato-in-america/), Morano Gelato prepares their gelato and sorbets fresh daily using seasonal, local ingredients whenever possible. Fun fact: the groom's favorite flavor is dark chocolate and the bride's favorite is Nutella.

Looking for something to do between the ceremony and reception? Stop by the Baker Berry Library across the street from Rollins Chapel and check out the [Orozco Mural](http://researchguides.dartmouth.edu/orozco). The mural, by Jos√© Clemente Orozco, is a 20th-century fresco entitled "the Epic of Civilization." Spanning the entire basement study area, this is an impressive work of art and should not be missed.
